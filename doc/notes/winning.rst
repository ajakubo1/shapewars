How to win
==========

I don't want winning to be obvious or easy for the whole game. That's why winning conditions will be changed every 1 minute. The way of deciding on objective:

Server, after a minute will send request to chosen browser to decide on the goal, every other browser would have to comply with it.

Some goals can randomly choose a restriction (eg. conquer player, but can't conquer any other additional neutral square)
