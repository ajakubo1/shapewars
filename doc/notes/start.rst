==========
Game Start
==========

The game will start with a window to enter:

    * player's name
    * map size (2 players or 4 player)

After 'logging', player is waiting for another player to connect. When the appropriate amount of player is in the waiting bay, the game is initiated for every player. The map is generated on the server side (.. todo:: Test that...)
