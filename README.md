# shapewars

Shapewars is a HTML5 game for http://js13kgames.com/ competition.

Welcome to Flatland, a world in peril and war. A world of changes. Be the conqueror. The leader. The warchief. Order brave Shapes to victory, or embrace cold grip of dissemination. Lines to lines, corners to corners.

Mechanics explanation:

When you start a game, the screen will be centered on your little Flatland kingdom. You can move through Flatlands by click & drag/touch & drag/wasd/arrow keys. Attack neighbour squares by clicking them. Every click is an order to attack for nearest Shapes in region.

Every flatland region has a maximum amount of Shapes it can hold (white boxes). Take that into consideration when you conquer additional lands. One shape is generated every couple of seconds when a region is at peace.

Every Shape has a health indicator (white little squares above the Shape). It does not regenerate.

Reverse mechanism:
Watch out, for this chaotic world changes rapidly. Every couple of seconds objectives & map restrictions may change rapidly.


It will be much better with networking, but I thnik I won't be able to finish on time :/... A shame.
